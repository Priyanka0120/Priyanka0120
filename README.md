Hey! I am Priyanka Gupta, a software professional, currently working as a Senior Consultant with CEGAL. I have more than 8 years of extensive experience in software consulting and development in various SCRUM and Agile environments.

I am passionate and enthusiastic about intelligent systems and smart automated solutions of the future. My great interest is in learning Microsoft Azure and AI with an aim to be a Cloud Solution Architect.

My most experience is in: SQL Server database, GIT, C# and .Net Framework. Fortunately, I landed a job where I got the opportunity to build understanding and implementing Logic Apps, Azure functions, Azure DevOps.

I am extremely curious about reading space facts and astronomy 🪐🔭🌍. So in my free time, I either enjoy reading so or I can be found enjoying indoor gardening, singing or painting.

Forever, a learner...
